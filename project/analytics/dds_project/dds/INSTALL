General
=======

These are all command-line instructions.  If you want to compile
the code from an integrated development environment, you probably
know what you're doing and you'll figure it out :-).

The first step is to compile the library.

If you have trouble, read the Makefile.  They all have the compiler
warning levels set rather high, and they are set to fail even on
warnings.  You can turn this off.  The Visual C++ version also
requires a couple of tools that you may not have, but this too is
easy to turn off.

If you want, the optional next step is to test the library.

Generally speaking:

* Your paths and your system must be set up ahead of time.
* You must have "make", or you will have to find a manual way
  of compiling.
* If your compiler does not have the name that we assume in 
  the Makefile, then modify the Makefile.

Once you've tested the source, you'll need the library file, the
dll.h include from the include directory, and possibly other files
such as dll.lib, depending on the exact system.  You don't need
include/portab.h, although you're welcome to use it.  The library
files needed are:

Microsoft Visual C++: dds.dll, dds.lib
mingw and cygwin: dds.dll, dds.def
Mac and linux: libdds.a


General instructions
====================

1. Go to the src directory.

2. Copy the right Makefile_... from the Makefiles sub-directory
to the src directory and call it Makefile, see below. (Or use make -f)

3. If your compiler does not have the name assumed in the Makefile
(see below), modify the Makefile.

4. If you don't have the "windres" and "cvtres" programs,
then you can also manage without.  These are just used for
getting version information into the DLL.  Delete the corresponding
lines.

5. If you want OpenMP rather than Windows multi-threading for
some reason, find the right place in the Makefile and uncomment
one line and comment the other.

6. make clean (not necessary if you're starting clean).

7. make depend (ditto).

8. make (produces dds.dll on Windows, libdds.a on Linux and Mac).

9. make install (if you want to run tests; this is only a
local install to ../lib, not a system-wide one).


System-specific data
====================

Microsoft Visual C++ (Unix-like, so Cygwin and mingw)
--------------------
Makefile: Makefile_Visual
Compiler: cl


Microsoft Visual C++ (Windows-like, so no "mV", different "make")
--------------------
Makefile: Makefile_Visual_Windows
Compiler: cl


Mingw
-----
Makefile: Makefile_mingw
Compiler: i686-w64-mingw32-g++

32-bit and 64-bit variants for the tdc compiler are available.


Cygwin
------
Makefile: Makefile_cygwin
Compiler: g++


Linux (static library .a)
=====
Makefile: Makefile_linux
Compiler: g++


Linux (dynamic library .ld)
=====
Makefile: Makefile_linux_shared
Compiler: g++


Apple
=====
Makefile: Makefile_Mac_clang (for clang compiler, single-threaded)
Compiler: g++
Supports both OpenMP and GDD multi-threading.

Makefile: Makefile_Mac_gcc (for GNU g++ compiler, multi-threaded)
Makefile: Makefile_Mac_shared (for GNU g++ compiler, multi-threaded)


Testing
=======

The step "make install" above should have put the library file
in ../lib.

test
----
This program tests five main modes of DDS:

* solve, the solution of a hand for a given declarer and strain.
* calc, the solution of a hand for all 4 declarers * 5 strains.
* play, the checking of play vs. double-dummy place.
* par, the par calculation.
* dealerpar, the dealer par calculation.

The program can use a number of pre-defined input files in the
../hands directory.

To compile the program, you follow the same steps as for the library,
except that you don't do a "make install".

You now have a program called "dtest" or "dtest.exe".  Let us 
assume dtest.exe.  Let us also assume that your system is set up
in such a way that your path does not include the current working
directory.

You can invoke the program as

./dtest.exe

which should just give a brief usage message.  If that works, then
you can invoke the program like this:

./dtest.exe file.txt mode [number of threads]

file.txt has to be the name of a file EITHER in the current 
directory OR in ../hands.  The program checks first in the current
directory.  A good starting example is list100.txt.

mode has to be one of solve, calc, play, parand dealerpar.

The number of threads is optional.  If it is not supplied, DDS
figures one out itself.  If it is supplied, then it is passed to
SetMaxThreads().

Generally speaking, the test program first shows some information
about how it was compiled.  Then it shows some ongoing timing
information which can be useful to see that the program hasn't
frozen in a long run.  Then it shows some timing information
including an average per hand.

The program compares results against expected values.  If something
isn't right, you will see it.  If only specific hands fails, then
we are surprised -- please report it to us.


ddd
---
This program was written by Flip Cronje, and we have modified it
minimally to support a multi-threaded DLL.  However, it doesn't
use the full capabilities of DDS, as it was written at a time when
functions such as CalcAllTables and SolveAllBoards were not yet
available.  Therefore it is rather slow, but it does have a nice
hand generator built in.


examples
--------
The previous tests are intended for testing, not for teaching
anybody how to interface with the DDS library.

Here we show some minimal examples of using various DDS functions.
These are short programs with only the minimum needed to get going.
You can build on these for your own purposes.
